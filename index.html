  <h1>Godzilla King of Monsters</h1>
  <p>
    Godzilla was made in a neclear blast and the radiation changed a little lizard into a monstrous beast. Godzilla hates man for burning eveything down where he lived, all life was destroyed in the fire when man set it on fire.

    There was an alternait version of him that was built by humns that they called "MechaGodzilla." MechaGodzilla was made to fight Godzilla like an antiweapon for him, but there is a time that he will go haywire and attack the city because he has some of Godzilla's DNA in him.

      Godzilla's blood cell's are self-regenerating, they can heal them selfs within seconds. His cells not just heal the blood but his skin tissue, nervous system, there was even a moment where he took a neclear missle to the heart and still survived.

        Godzilla has many enemies, some even can change forms to get stronger or to get bigger. For some reason Godzillas protects man from these monsters even tho they did bad things to him. He kills, destroys, even blowup everyone of theses monsters and wins every time even when he is weak.

            Spacegodzilla is am alien from space taking the image of Godzilla. It came to earth to dominate and rule, but Godzilla  knew something was wrong amd traveled many miles to face and defeat Spacegodzilla. Spacegodzilla can summon giant crystals from the earth and these crystals can release an electric field that can harm Godzilla but heal Spacegodzilla.

              If you wanted to know where Godzilla came from, he came from a valley in Tokyo, Japan. The valley he was born in wwas lush and green with nature florishing everywhere, but the military thought it was the right spot to test there nuclear missles, and weapons. When the missles hit the valley was destroyed and eveything in it, Godzilla was mad and angry that he went Agro. He sout out the humans who did this and destroyed there cities and villages. Godzilla will never forgive them for what they did to him.

                There is something that none of us thought that would happen within 64years. In the last battle to save earth Godzilla finaly forgave humans for everything they did to. Minilla went in front a child and protected him as a sighn of saying say stop its finaly over. <P>
